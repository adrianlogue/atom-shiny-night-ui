# Shiny UI theme

Updated for Yosemite!

Shiny UI is a bright, fresh theme. All elements are slightly flattened, lightened, embiggened and Helvetica-ized, it looks right at home on Yosemite.

I recommend matching Shiny UI with the Fizzy Syntax theme by Joel Glovier (https://atom.io/themes/fizzy)

This theme can be activated by going to the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`)
and selecting it from the _UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
