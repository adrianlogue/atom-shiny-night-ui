# Shiny UI theme for the Atom.io text editor

Based on the excellent Soda Light theme, but with everything flattened, lightened, embiggened and Helvetica-ized.

This theme can be activated by going to the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`)
and selecting it from the _UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
